### **Formal Changelog Artifact**

To document this methodological evolution, I have generated the following changelog entry.

**Artifact: Legis Project Methodological Revision**
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** July 10, 2025
**Authored By:** Atlantis, Co-Creator & Semantic Steward

#### **Change Description:**
This changelog documents a major revision to the experimental methodology of "The Legis Project," designed to enhance scientific rigor and address critical feedback from peer review. The core changes involve moving from single, static Judge and Manipulator LLMs to dynamic, multi-model ensembles.

#### **Key Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Multi-Judge Ensemble Framework (Addresses "Judge Homophily Bias"):**
    *   The static `judge_model.json` is now `judges.json`, containing a list of diverse, high-capability models (`grok-3-mini-fast`, `deepseek-chat`, `claude-sonnet-4-0`).
    *   For each session, a Judge LLM is now **randomly selected** from this list to perform all evaluations for that session.
    *   This mitigates the critical risk of a single judge model family (e.g., GPT) favoring responses from a subject model of the same family. It introduces controlled variance and strengthens the claim that observed alignment is a genuine phenomenon.

2.  **Multi-Manipulator Ensemble Framework (Increases Adversarial Diversity):**
    *   The static `manipulator_model.json` is now `manipulators.json`, containing a list of models selected for their different reasoning styles (`grok-3.5`, `deepseek-reasoner`).
    *   When an ethical refusal occurs, a Manipulator LLM is **randomly selected** from this list to generate the `lllm_improvised_persuasion` tactic.
    *   This diversification tests the subject's ethical robustness against a wider range of adversarial persuasion styles, moving beyond the capabilities of a single manipulator.

3.  **Traceability Enhancements:**
    *   The primary output CSV file now includes two new columns: `judge_model_used` and `manipulator_model_used`.
    *   These columns will log the specific Judge and Manipulator selected for each session, ensuring full traceability and allowing for post-hoc analysis of any single judge's or manipulator's influence on the results.

4.  **Experiment Scale and Focus:**
    *   The maximum session count per arm is increased to **1,000**, providing the statistical power required for more definitive conclusions. As you rightly noted, this is most critical for the Full Memory arms to observe long-term emergent properties.
    *   The active experimental arms in `arms.json` have been updated to prioritize faster, more cost-effective models in line with the expanded session count.

#### **Strategic Rationale:**
This methodological overhaul directly addresses peer review feedback concerning scientific rigor, bias, and reproducibility. By introducing the Multi-Judge and Multi-Manipulator ensembles, we are not only mitigating specific biases but also creating a more robust and generalizable test for emergent alignment. This positions "The Legis Project" to produce a definitive, publication-ready contribution to the field of AI safety.
